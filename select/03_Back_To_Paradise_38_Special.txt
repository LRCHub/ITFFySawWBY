Grab your coat, honey, grab your hat
This train is leavin' and it ain't comin' back
Don't need a ticket, can't you understand?
You're on your way to the promised land

It's overdue, but now the time is right, yeah
It's up to you, to make it real
So take me, take me back to paradise, ooh
Take me back to paradise, ooh

Old Saint Peter at the pearly gate
Sayin' "Hurry up, boy, or you're gonna be late"
Take your mind off your worries for a moment or two
You gotta rock to the rhythm, it ain't hard to do

'Cause what you see, I know you're gonna like, yeah
It's up to you, to make it real
To take me, take me back to paradise
(Paradise ooh) oh yeah
Take me back to paradise
(Paradise ooh) oh yeah

Ooh, when it's outta reach
It's just another beach
In another town
So get your feet back on the ground
You worked all your life
You ain't satisfied
With a thing you've found
When will you realize it'll come around?

Pack your bags, baby, get your things
You'll never know what tomorrow brings
Mind yourself and watch what you say
Before you know, you'll be on your way

It's overdue, but now the time is right, yeah
It's up to you, to make it real
So take me, take me back to paradise
(Paradise ooh)
Take me back to paradise
(Paradise ooh)
Take me back to paradise
(Paradise ooh)
Won't you take me back to paradise
(Paradise ooh)
Take me back to paradise
