This, this is the opening night
For you and me and the rest of our lives alive
Dance, dance with me I'll never uprise for lie
Tonight I will make you divine
With the looks of a goddess you will make me cry

Take me back to paradise baby
Back in to your wonderland
Take me back to paradise baby now and forever

Life, where all things are shallow and deep
Show, short but it lasts for eternity
Me, I know I'll never get everything
Tonight I would still like to try
And I know that tomorrow I'll try one more time

Take me back to paradise baby
Back in to your wonderland
Take me back to paradise baby now and forever
Take me back to paradise baby
Back in to your wonderland
Take me back to paradise baby now and forever

Come, let me take off that gown
Come, less is more but you're better without

Take me back to paradise baby
Back in to your wonderland
Take me back to paradise baby now and forever
Take me back to paradise baby
Back in to your wonderland
Take me back to paradise baby now and forever
Take me back to paradise baby
Back in to your wonderland
Take me back to paradise baby now and forever
Take me back to paradise baby
Back in to your wonderland
Take me back to paradise baby now and forever
