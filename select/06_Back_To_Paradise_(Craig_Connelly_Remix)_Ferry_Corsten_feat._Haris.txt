These are the years
That will be forever in our memories Memories of everlasting ecstasy
Climbing to the top of the world
As soon as the hour glass
Will run out we'll fill it up again
Up again till we leave them wondering How we'll always be the way we are
We are
We are
And when you lose your way
Lose your place
Lost your faith
I'll carry you back When you lose your way
Lose your place
Lost your faith
I'll take you back to paradise
And when you lose your way
Lose your place
Lost your faith
I'll take you back to paradise
These are the years
That will be forever in our memories Memories of everlasting ecstasy
Climbing to the top of the world As soon as the hour glass
Will run out we'll fill it up again
Up again till we leave them wondering How we'll always be the way we are
We are
We are
And when you lose your way
Lose your place
Lost your faith
I'll take you back to paradise
I'll carry you back
When you lose your way Lose your place Lost your faith
I'll take you back to paradise
